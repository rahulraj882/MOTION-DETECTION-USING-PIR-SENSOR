# MOTION-DETECTION-USING-PIR-SENSOR
**Detection of motion of humans using passive infrared sensor**

**INTRODUCTION**

A motion detector is a device that detects moving objects, particularly people. 
Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically 
performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. They form a vital component 
of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency and other
useful systems.

**MATERIALS REQUIRED :**

 PIR Sensor Module
 9v power supply(battery)
 LED
 1k resistors -2
 IN4148-Diode8
 
 IN4007-Diode
 BC547 transistors
 330 micro farad capacitor
 Buzzer
 Breadboard
 Jumper wires

**CONCLUSION:**

Motion detection is an essential part of security systems and PIR sensor is one of 
the most commonly used sensor for trigging the alarms when motion is detected. 
This sensor can detect human/animal movements easily by sensing the IR rays 
emitted by them. We previously used PIR sensor to build various kind of alarms 
and security systems
