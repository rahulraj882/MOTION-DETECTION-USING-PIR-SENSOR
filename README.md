# MOTION-DETECTION-USING-PIR-SENSOR
Detection of motion of humans using passive infrared sensor
**INTRODUCTION**
A motion detector is a device that detects moving objects, particularly people. 
Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically 
performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. They form a vital component 
of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency and other
useful systems.

**PIR Sensor operation **
****Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor is the foundation of the security system. The sensor's 
functionality is based on infrared radiations emitted from the human body. It is a 
useful tool for detection of human movement as it detects a change in infrared 
radiations as a result of moving warm-blooded objects within their range. All 
objects, including human beings, produce electromagnetic radiations. The 
wavelengths of these radiations are dependent on the temperature of objects. 
Human beings emit infrared radiation with wavelengths ranging between 0.7 and 
300 micrometres . On the other hand, normal body temperature of human beings 
radiates IR at wavelengths of 10 micrometres to 12 micrometres.PIR sensors, 
passive electronic devices detect motion by sensing the fluctuations of infrared 
radiations. Fig 2 below shows how the sensor detects human movements.
PIR sensor plays a passive role in the detection of infrared radiations i.e., it does 
not emit any emissions itself. Instead, the sensor passively detects infrared 
radiation emitted by human body within its range****

**CONCLUSION:**
Motion detection is an essential part of security systems and PIR sensor is one of 
the most commonly used sensor for trigging the alarms when motion is detected. 
This sensor can detect human/animal movements easily by sensing the IR rays 
emitted by them. We previously used PIR sensor to build various kind of alarms 
and security systems
